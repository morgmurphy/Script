3For as long as I could remember,

the four of us shared everything.

Stories...

...secrets...

...laughter...

...broken hearts.

So when we found a pair of pants that,

by some miracle, fit each of us perfectly...

...we took it on faith they'd come

into our lives for a reason.

That summer and the two that followed...

...the pants had the magic

of keeping us together.

No matter where they found us.

[BLOWS WHISTLE]

BRIDGET:

Bring it in!

CARMEN:

They saw us through times of love...

...times of loss...

MAN:
CongratuIations.

-...and times of change.

And those moments where you

feel your life just lift up...

...and take off.

Let go!

That fall when we left for college, I watched

each of my friends settle into a new life.

-Cut!

-Tibby was at NYU.

Bridget made the soccer team at Brown.

And Lena? She was on scholarship

at Rhode Island School of Design.

They made it look so easy,

fitting right in and making new friends...

...while I was at Yale just waiting

for something to feel real or familiar.

I was lost without them, especially when

it felt like my mom was moving on too.

I believed that the Sisterhood

could survive anything.

But maybe the pants had done

just about all a pair of pants could do...

...and the rest

we had to learn on our own.

How to become ourselves

without losing each other.

LENA:

Kostos?

I'm so sorry, Lena.

I know how much Bapi meant to you.

It's good to see you.

-These past few months have just--

-Lena.

I've missed you.

I onIy broke up with you because--

[SPEAKING IN GREEK]

Lena...

...this is MeIia.

My wife.
